# A Blockchain with Golang
Welcome to A Blockchain with Golang! This project is an implementation of a simple blockchain using the Go programming language. It provides a basic framework for understanding the principles behind blockchain technology and serves as a learning resource for developers interested in blockchain development with Golang.

## Features
1. **Blockchain Structure:** Implements the basic structure of a blockchain, including blocks, transactions, and hashing algorithms.

2. **Proof-of-Work:** Utilizes a proof-of-work algorithm to secure the blockchain and prevent tampering with transaction history.

3. **Decentralization:** Provides functionality for creating a peer-to-peer network of nodes to distribute the blockchain and validate transactions.

4. **Consensus Mechanism:** Implements a consensus mechanism (e.g., longest chain rule) to achieve agreement among nodes on the valid blockchain.

5. **Transaction Validation:** Validates transactions and ensures that only valid transactions are added to the blockchain.

## Installation
To set up A Blockchain with Golang:

1. **Download:** Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

git clone https://github.com/RadinaAvramova/A-Blockchain-With-Golang.git

2. **Navigate to the Directory:** Change your current directory to the location of the cloned repository:

cd A-Blockchain-With-Golang

3. **Run the Application:** Use the Go tooling to run the application:

go run main.go

## Usage
1. **Initialize Blockchain:** Start by initializing a new blockchain.

2. **Add Transactions:** Add transactions to the blockchain.

3. **Mine Blocks:** Mine blocks to validate transactions and add them to the blockchain.

4. **Explore Blockchain:** View the contents of the blockchain, including blocks, transactions, and balances.

5. **Decentralization:** Join or create a network of nodes to distribute the blockchain and achieve consensus.

## Configuration
1. **Customize Parameters:** Adjust parameters such as the difficulty level of proof-of-work, block reward, and transaction fees to customize the behavior of the blockchain.

2. **Network Configuration:** Configure network settings such as peer addresses and communication protocols for node interaction.

3. **Security Measures:** Implement additional security measures such as encryption, authentication, and access control to enhance the security of the blockchain network.
